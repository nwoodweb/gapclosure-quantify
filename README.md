# gapclosure-quantify

Gap closure assays are rudiementary ways of assessing cell migration.
This is accomplished by growing a confluent monolayer of mammalian
cells on a substrate such that the entire surface is covered with cells.
The monolayer is then abraded and changes in the gap size as cells
migrate are then measured.

This script employs image processing techniques to automate the quantification
of gap size in large time-lapse image sets.
